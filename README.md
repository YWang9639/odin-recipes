# odin-recipes
In this project, I am making a recipe page. I have learned all the tags for headings and the paragraph tag. I have also learned how to italise and bold words or phrases. I have also learned how to add links and images to my website. Most importantly, I have learned how to use the terminal effectively for coding. It is a very useful tool.
